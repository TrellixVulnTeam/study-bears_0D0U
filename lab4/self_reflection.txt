All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I should have used more private helper functions to keep the code concise and easy to follow. This would have prevented the numerous if statements and edge cases for each method.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I donâ€™t feel proud of anything in particular.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: My resize and checkUsageRatio method were almost identical and redundant. Instead, I could have used only the resize method and perhaps private helper functions to tweak the operations within the method.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I could have known that SystemArrayCopy is not necessary and iteration can be more useful. I also should have clarified the meaning of nextFirst and lastFirst before starting the project.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would use more private helper methods, and use % to wrap around instead of using so many conditional statements.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I should have used more variables to keep the code concise and for better readability instead of using sentinel.next.next.prev which is hard to understand and follow.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I felt proud of short, concise logic in my methods.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: In a addFirst and addLast specifically, there were more conditional statements than necessary.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Nothing.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would use variables to store the nodes when keeping track of the pointers.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I liked this design review process.
